# Change-Analysis-of-Water-Bodies-CNN-OBIA
As a part of Academic Final year Project, My team had chose this project to get hands on with the remote sensing datasets and also to get the greater knowledge on how the satellite imageries can be utilzed to make fine analysis and get the insights.

# Objectives
&nbsp;&nbsp;  Change analysis of Water Bodies Using CNN and OBIA is a project focused on using satellite imagery to classify the water bodies and land mass using CNN model. Then using OBIA to check the rate of difference in the water bodies from 2018 to 2024 using the NWDI images of sentinel - 2 satellite obtained from [Copernicus Hub ](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) and [Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/) . In the given websites links you can prepare your own mask layers to get the required masks over the maps or you can use the already prepared images which basically prepared by using the band values using which the sentinel images have captured the images.\
&nbsp;&nbsp; Collecting the satellite imagery data from various sources and also using the existing sources into consideration for building the model. By Using methods such as OBIA(Object based Image analysis) and CNN (Convolutional Neural networks) to make the analysis and prediction in future works to tackle the situations of water scarcity, flooding and illegal occupation over waterbodies by using the satellite imageries over the years. At recent most widely used are UAV such as drones but it wont be feasible enough to monitor over the years and even the seasonal changes in mass area. It is important that to consider the Satellite imagery for the greater good and it will open the door for evolution in the Satellite data usage.
